# kxdbweb Tests

Run the application:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Works as expected

Run tests (optional with coverage)

```
npm run test
npm run coverage
```

fails with:

> TypeError: Failed to execute 'digest' on 'SubtleCrypto': 2nd argument is not instance of ArrayBuffer, Buffer, TypedArray, or DataView.

What do I miss?
